        In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, supporting branches and leaves in most species. 
        In some usages, the definition of a tree may be narrower, including only wood plants with secondary growth, plants that are usable as lumber or plants above a specified height.
        In wider definitions, the taller palms, tree ferns, bananas, and bamboos are also trees. 
        Trees are not a taxonomic group but include a variety of plant species that have independently evolved a trunk and branches as a way to tower above other plants to compete for sunlight. 
        Trees tend to be long-lived, some reaching several thousand years old. 
        Trees have been in existence for 370 million years. 
        It is estimated that there are some three trillion mature trees in the world.
